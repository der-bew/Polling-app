## Developer Reflection: AI-Generated Tests

  #### What worked?

  The AI did an excellent job with the foundational setup and core
  logic.

   - Boilerplate and Configuration: It correctly identified the
     need for Jest and generated the standard Next.js + TypeScript
     configuration (jest.config.mjs, jest.setup.js) without any
     errors. This saved a significant amount of time that would
     otherwise be spent on tedious setup.
   - Test Case Identification: The AI demonstrated a strong
     understanding of the code by identifying the most critical
     test cases. It covered authentication, input validation, the
     "happy path," and crucial failure scenarios like database
     errors.
   - Mocking Strategy: It correctly identified all external
     dependencies (createSupabaseServerClient, revalidatePath,
     redirect) and mocked them appropriately. This is fundamental
     for creating true unit tests that run in isolation.

  #### What didnâ€™t?

  The initial implementation of the mocks for the Supabase client
  was a bit verbose and complex. The chained nature of the client
  (supabase.from(...).select(...).single()) is tricky to mock
  elegantly. While the AI's first attempt would have worked, it
  required some conceptual refactoring to make the mocks cleaner
  and more maintainable for future tests, particularly by using a
  more centralized beforeEach setup.

  #### What surprised you?

  I was most surprised by the AI's depth of understanding of the
  specific technologies and logic involved.

   * Supabase-Specific Knowledge: The AI knew the specific Supabase
     error code PGRST116 indicates that no rows were found, and it
     correctly wrote a test to handle that specific case when
     checking if a user had already voted. This is not generic
     knowledge; it shows the AI understood the library's API.
   * Transactional Logic: I was very impressed that it created a
     test for the cleanup logic. It correctly inferred that if
     creating poll options failed, the previously created poll
     record should be deleted. Testing this kind of transactional
     rollback is a hallmark of a thorough test suite and not
     something I would have expected it to catch.
